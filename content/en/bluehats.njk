      <h1><code>BlueHats</code>, who's inÂ ?</h1>
      <p>
	The <code>BlueHats</code> are all the people who want to show that they contribute to Free and Open Source software developed and/or used by public administrations <strong>all over the world</strong>: civil servants involved in the use and development of these software, of course, but also citizens who recognise that their actions in favour of Free Software help the administration's projects.
      </p>
      <p>
	<code>BlueHats</code> is <em>not</em> a product or a brand of the French Free Software unit. It's a global movement to which our unit contributes by publishing a <a href="/fr/bluehats/tags/gazette/">newsletter in French</a>, organising <a href="/fr/bluehats/tags/atelier/">online workshops</a> and <a href="/fr/bluehats/tags/rencontre/">face-to-face meetings</a>. All public administrations around the world are invited to contribute to this movement!

      <h2><code>BlueHats events</code></h2>
      <p>
	You can start by organising <code>BlueHats</code> events, inviting people to support Free Software in the public sector by sharing their expertise, hacking, etc.  Events do not have to be big hackathons: even small face-to-face meetings are useful.
      </p>
      <h2><code>BlueHats online workshops</code></h2>
      <p>
	As a civil servant, you can easily share your expertise on Free Software through online workshops to which you can invite other civil servants.
      </p>
      <h2><code>BlueHats newsletters</code></h2>
      <p>
	If your administration is willing to commit to spreading information about the progress of Free Software in the public sector, it can publish a newsletter.
